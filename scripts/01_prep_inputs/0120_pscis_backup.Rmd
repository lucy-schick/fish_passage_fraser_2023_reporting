# Purpose of this script

This scripts is used to backup `form_pscis_2024.gpkg` file before QA in QGIS.

As of January 2025, we are now doing all pre-QA edits in QGIS instead of R, to reduce the amount of back and forth between Q and R. Most of the changes previously made in this script have been moved to `0130_pscis_export_to_template.R`. 


## Fetch and backup the data

Name the project directory we are pulling from and import the data. We use `fpr_sp_gpkg_backup` to import and backup the data, as well as update the UTMS. We will also write the data to a csv and Rdata file and commit for version control using git. Commit these inital backup files with a message such as "initial commit - raw 2024 data".

`update_site_id = TRUE` now checks for duplicate sites.

```{r import}
path_form_pscis <- fs::path('~/Projects/gis/sern_peace_fwcp_2023/data_field/2024/form_pscis_2024.gpkg')

form_pscis <- fpr::fpr_sp_gpkg_backup(
  path_gpkg = path_form_pscis,
  dir_backup = "data/backup/",
  update_utm = TRUE,
  update_site_id = FALSE, ## This now also checks for duplicates
  write_back_to_path = FALSE,
  write_to_csv = TRUE,
  write_to_rdata = TRUE,
  return_object = TRUE)
  
```

## QA in QGIS

The following should be done in QGIS:

- remove the site used to make the form (with site_id = '12345')
- back up the original assessment comments so we can redo this amalgamation of text if we need to. Use the field calculator, select generate new field, name it `assessment_comment_og`, and select `assessment_comment` in the expression box. 
- reorder the columns for easy QA in Q
