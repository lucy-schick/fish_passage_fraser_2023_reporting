  abstract = {Objective We describe juvenile migration tactics for spring/summer-run populations of Chinook Salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha that spawn in tributaries of the Fraser River, Canada. Methods We trapped juveniles migrating from tributaries, and sampled juvenile Chinook salmon rearing in the Fraser River. Result In four tributaries, we found two dominant life history types within each population: a natal-stream-rearing variant in which juveniles spend a year in their natal stream before migrating to the sea as yearling smolts; and a fry migrant variant in which juveniles disperse downstream from spawning areas to the Fraser River main stem soon after emergence. In a fifth tributary, where flows are regulated, juveniles migrated as parr later in the spring. Juveniles colonized the Fraser River main stem in spring and were distributed throughout the accessible length of the main stem. Their relative density in nearshore habitats was similar to that observed in other rivers. Migrants spend up to a year in the main stem before smolting as yearlings. Conclusion The extensive year-round use of the Fraser River main stem appears to be unique among Chinook Salmon-producing watersheds, likely due to favorable environmental conditions in the main stem during the spring and summer months. The diversity of habitats used by these populations is an important consideration for the design of conservation programs that are intended to maintain or improve freshwater productivity.},

Coho salmon were predominant at "natural' river sites while steelhead trout was the main species at sites with "rip-rap' bank stabilization. Catches of juvenile coho were much much lower in the main river than in the ponds where they were the main species, and were more variable in the river. Population density and biomass estimates of juvenile coho in the ponds ranged from 0.100 fish.m-2 and 1.00 g.m-2 to 1.00 fish.m-2 and 5.15 g.m-2, compared with density estimates of 0.08-0.23 fish.m-2 in the river. The coho population in the ponds consisted of 0+ and 1+ age-groups in similar proportions; in the main river the 0+ age-group was much more abundant. Growth rate of coho in the ponds was faster than in the main river, with pond fish reaching mean lengths of 62-79 mm at the end of the 1st growing season, compared with 53 mm in the main river. Smolt outmigration from the main study pond occurred in late spring with peak outmigration in May and June coinciding with peak river discharge and increasing water temperatures in the main river and pond. -from Authors}
